## About
Grey Cat The Flag is an annual CTF hosted by NUS Greyhats, and I am really honoured to contribute to this event. 

I wrote 2-ish challenges for the Finals (1 Crypto, 1+1 MISC) and I have included them here. The writeup includes some explanation and more refined solve scripts not committed to the official repo. You can also refer to the [official gctf25 repo](https://github.com/NUSGreyhats/greyctf25-challs-public/tree/main/finals) for the other challenges in the finals.
