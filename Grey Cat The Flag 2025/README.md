## About
Grey Cat The Flag is an annual CTF hosted by NUS Greyhats, and I am really honoured to contribute to this event. 

I wrote four challenges for the Qualifiers (2 OSINT, 2 MISC) and I have included them here. I also added some extra details that were left out of the [official gctf25 writeups](https://github.com/NUSGreyhats/greyctf25-challs-public) (as I committed them a bit too late) to add some more context or information.
