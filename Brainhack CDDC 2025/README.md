## About
Brainhack is an annual event organised by DSTA, offering a unique hands-on experience into the future of digital technology. Dive into the realms of Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Space Tech, Software Development, Robotics and many more.Among the events, CDDC is the program for Cybersecurity, with a Jeopardy-style Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competition.

This year, the competition was help over 2 days (starting at past noon on day 1, and ending evening on day 2). I managed to solve 1 challenge, which was an improvement from my 0 challenge solved last year.

I was also close to solving a second, but I made a crucial mistake which resulted in me not getting the full flag.
